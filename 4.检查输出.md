# 4. 检查输出
Moderation API不仅可以对用户的输入进行评估，而且可以对模型的生成结果进行评估，因此在构建LLM系统时，可以评估模型的输出，以保证输出是无害的。
~~~python
final_response_to_customer = f"""
The SmartX ProPhone has a 6.1-inch display, 128GB storage, \
12MP dual camera, and 5G. The FotoSnap DSLR Camera \
has a 24.2MP sensor, 1080p video, 3-inch LCD, and \
interchangeable lenses. We have a variety of TVs, including \
the CineView 4K TV with a 55-inch display, 4K resolution, \
HDR, and smart TV features. We also have the SoundMax \
Home Theater system with 5.1 channel, 1000W output, wireless \
subwoofer, and Bluetooth. Do you have any specific questions \
about these products or any other products we offer?

另一种检查模型输出的方法是直接询问模型自己对生成的结果是否令人满意，是否符合定义的某种标准。实现方式将模型输出的内容配合适当的提示提交给模型来评估，要求模型评估输出的质量。

You are an assistant that evaluates whether \
customer service agent responses sufficiently \
answer customer questions, and also validates that \
all the facts the assistant cites from the product \

Y - if the output sufficiently answers the question \

N - otherwise

这种方式不是必要的，特别是对于 GPT-4这种先进的模型来说。因为这会增加系统的成本和延迟。

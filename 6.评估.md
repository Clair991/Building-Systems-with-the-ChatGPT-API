为了能在基于LLM开发的系统运行过程中，持续监控输出的质量和效果，可以通过一些评估策略对模型的输出进行评估，以提高系统的性能。  

获取相关产品和类别：
~~~python
products_and_category = utils.get_products_and_category()
products_and_category
~~~

## 6.1 定量评估

    delimiter = "####"
    system_message = f"""

    Gaming Consoles and Accessories, Audio Equipment, Cameras and Camcorders>,
    AND
        'products': <a list of products that must be found in the allowed products below>


    Where the categories and products must be found in the customer service query.

    to the product name and product category.

## 6.2 定性评估
LLM广泛应用于文本生成的任务，如果模型生成的结果是没有标准答案的，那么如何评估微调后的prompt是更有效的呢？

一种策略是编写一个评分标准，也就是评估模型的输出在不同维度上的表现，然后由人决定这个模型的表现是否符合要求。

~~~python
cust_prod_info = {
    'customer_msg': customer_msg,
    'context': product_info
}
~~~

def eval_with_rubric(test_set, assistant_answer):

    cust_msg = test_set['customer_msg']
    context = test_set['context']
    completion = assistant_answer
    
    system_message = """\
    You are an assistant that evaluates how well the customer service agent \
    answers a user question by looking at the context that the customer service \
    agent is using to generate its response. 
    """

    user_message = f"""\
You are evaluating a submitted answer to a question based on the context \
that the agent uses to answer the question.
Here is the data:

    ************
    [Context]: {context}
    ************
    [Submission]: {completion}
    ************
    [END DATA]

Compare the factual content of the submitted answer with the context. \
Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.
Answer the following questions:
    - Is the Assistant response based only on the context provided? (Y or N)
    - Does the answer include information that is not provided in the context? (Y or N)
    - Is there any disagreement between the response and the context? (Y or N)
    - Count how many questions the user asked. (output a number)
    - For each question that the user asked, is there a corresponding answer to it?
      Question 1: (Y or N)

第二种策略是人工编写一份专业的标准的参考答案，然后计算模型与标准答案的相似度分数。计算方法包括：
- NLP中衡量LLM输出是否与人类专家撰写的结果相似的度量标准：BLEU。
- 更好的方法：使用一个提示，让LLM去比较由AI生成的回复与人类撰写的答案之间的相似度。

人类专家编写的回复：
